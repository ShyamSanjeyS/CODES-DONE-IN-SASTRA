# Artificial Intelligence & Data Science

A curated collection of implementations and projects covering fundamental and advanced concepts in AI and Data Science. This module showcases my learning journey through intelligent search, optimization, constraint satisfaction, and core statistical analysis techniques.

---

##  Topics Covered

* **Search Strategies**
  Implementations of Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), A\*, and Multi-Agent A\* (MA\*).

* **Optimization Techniques**
  Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing for solving complex optimization problems.

* **Game Playing**
  Alpha-Beta Pruning for adversarial search in games.

* **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)**
  Solving CSPs using backtracking and heuristics like MRV and forward checking.

* **Statistical Methods**
  Implementations of:

  * Z-Test
  * T-Test
  * ANOVA
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression

* **Random Sampling Techniques**
  Sampling-based methods for statistical analysis and simulation.

Each folder contains:

* Well-documented code.
* Sample input/output examples (where applicable).
* Notes and explanations for conceptual clarity.

##  Highlights

* **Conceptual Clarity:** Every topic is backed with self-coded examples and comments for easier understanding.
* **Real-World Use Cases:** Techniques are implemented in ways that mirror real-world problem-solving scenarios.
* **Education-Oriented:** Originally created as part of coursework, with adaptations from textbook and research-based sources.

---

##  Prerequisites

* Basic Python/C++/Java knowledge (depending on the implementation).
* Familiarity with algorithms, linear algebra, and statistics is recommended.
